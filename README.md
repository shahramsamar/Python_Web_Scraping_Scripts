# Python Web Scraping Scripts

A collection of Python scripts for web scraping various types of data from websites. These scripts are designed to demonstrate different techniques and libraries commonly used in web scraping, such as `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `Selenium`.

## Features

- **Multiple Scraping Techniques**: Examples using `requests` for basic scraping and `Selenium` for handling JavaScript-rendered content.
- **Data Extraction**: Extracts structured data from HTML content, including text, images, and links.
- **Data Storage**: Options to save scraped data in formats such as CSV and JSON.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **pip** for installing dependencies

### Libraries

This project relies on the following Python libraries:

- `requests`: For making HTTP requests
- `BeautifulSoup4`: For parsing HTML and extracting data
- `Selenium`: For automating web browsers (for JavaScript content)
- `pandas`: For handling data (optional)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shahramsamar/python_Web_Scraping_Scripts.git
    cd python_Web_Scraping_Scripts
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

- Each script in the repository targets a specific website or demonstrates a specific scraping technique.
- To run a script, use:

    ```bash
    python <script_name>.py
    ```

- Some scripts may require additional setup, such as configuring a browser driver (e.g., `chromedriver` for Selenium).

### Project Structure

- `scripts/`: Directory containing individual scraping scripts.
- `output/`: Sample output files (e.g., CSV, JSON) for reference.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists project dependencies.
